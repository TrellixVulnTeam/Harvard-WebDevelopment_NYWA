SQL

PostgreSQL(psql)


Datatypes
-serial ->automate sequential integer
-varchar ->variable length string data type
-Char ->stores character data in a fixed-length field of string, single-byte or multibyte letters, numbers, and other characters
-integer
-INTEGER REFERENCES ->enforce the relationship


Constraints for data:
-NOT NULL
-UNIQUE
-PRIMARY KEY #contain unique value,cannot have null values.
-DEFAULT
-CHECK #more or less than x

create row = DATA TYPE + Constraints


Queries:

-CREATE TABLE

e.g create table to store flight information
CREATE TABLE flights(
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	origin VARCHAR NOT NULL, #origin col cannot be empty
	destination VARCHAR NOT NULL,
	duration INTEGER NOT NULL,
	)

-INSERT INTO
->adds information into the table
e.g
INSERT INTO flights
	(orgin,destination,duration)
	VALUES ('New York', 'London' , 415)


-SELECT 
->shows the data
>SELECT * #select everything 
>SELECT origin,destination FROM flights #shows only the origin and destination of flight
>SELECT * FROM flights WHERE id=3
>SELECT COUNT #counts no of rows from database
>SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin LIKE "%a%";  #% as placeholder. In this case it is searching for origins that have a in it.


-UPDATE
->modify data in the database.using the UPDATE query, you can set new values
e.g
UPDATE flights
	SET duration = 430  
	WHERE origin = 'New York'
	AND destination = 'London'


-DELETE
e.g DELETE FROM countries
	WHERE origin ='New York'

-JOIN
->joining 2 tables to form relational database
e.g 
//SELECT origin,destination,name FROM flights FROM flights JOIN passengers ON
//passenger.flight_id = flights.id;

>LEFT JOIN 
>RIGHT JOIN


-CREATE INDEX


Functions:
just specify which row/column u wantc
-AVG()
-MIN()
-MAX()
-SUM()



Relational database
->relating different table 

1. Create TABLE
	e.g CREATE TABLE passengers(
			id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
			name VARCHAR NOT NULL
			flight_id INTEGER REFERENCES flight) #flight id is the 				relation between table

2. INSERT INTO

3. JOIN
	e.g 
	//SELECT origin,destination,name FROM flights FROM flights JOIN passengers ON
	//passenger.flight_id = flights.id;



Nested Queries -> to get more specific query
//SELECT * FROM flights WHERE id IN (SELECT flights_id from passengers GROUP BY flight_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)


SQL Injection
e.g username and password
	SELECT * FROM users
		WHERE (username = username)
		AND (password = password

	Hacking into database with arbitrary commands(SQL Injection)
	SELECT * FROM users
	WHERE (username = 'hacker')
	AND (password = '1' OR '1' = '1')



Race Condition
->running queries simultaneously that exploits the data base
solution: 
starting a transactions to lock in the bank account
SQL Transactions:
-BEGIN 
-COMMIT

SQL Alchemy
-> library that allows python to run SQL Queries
